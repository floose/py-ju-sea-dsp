    "From the input data up to the D/A converter, everything is computed digitally in the transmitter, by using a digital signal processor or a microcontroller unit. Data is formatted into an OFDM symbol through an IFFT algorithm. The process is described as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "The modulator selects the symbols out of a constellation to represent the input data. A Serial to Parallell converter delivers the symbols into an IFFT algorithm, that transforms the amplitudes and phases of the carriers into a time-domain signal. The signal is then formatted with a well-defined pulse (e.g., a raised-cosine pulse) that is bandlimited.\n"
